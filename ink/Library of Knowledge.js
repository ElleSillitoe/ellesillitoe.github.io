She explained how it was accessible through reciting a traditional ritual which could only take place in one of their temples.","\n","^<i> Her voice quivered, and then in tears she dutifully described the arrival of the Equistadian colonisers, who she called 'Thuum', and the subsequent destruction of the walls, the city, and the temples.","\n","ev","str","^Turn page.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Stop reading.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Pip11"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"Stop"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Pip11":[["^<i>\"Ah, but Aama one still stands, right?\" Kaya interrupted, placing a comforting hand on Naani's shoulder to steady her.","\n","^<i>\"Yes, my dear.
