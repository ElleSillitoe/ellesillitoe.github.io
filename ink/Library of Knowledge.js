Port Notos was the heart of the empire’s shipbuilding industry, and its shipyards were renowned for their craftsmanship and the construction of sturdy vessels. The now-idle docks, lined with empty berths and unfinished hulls, serve as a stark reminder of the city's faded glory. The once-thriving shipbuilders and maritime workers have dispersed, leaving behind a desolate landscape of faded dreams and forgotten ambitions. Despite the city's present state, glimpses of its former grandeur can still be found - abandoned factories and workshops serve as reminders of the ingenuity and industrious spirit that once thrived within its walls. The city that once powered the empire’s trade now stands as a symbol of both the cost of closed borders and the resilience of its people, who refuse to let their industrious spirit be extinguished.</i>","\n","ev","str","^Turn page.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Skip to religion.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},"ev","str","^Stop reading.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-2","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Roselith9"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"Roselith11"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-2":["^ ",{"->":"Stop"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Roselith9":[["^<i>Chelium - The city of Chelium stands as a shadowed haven, situated in close proximity to the neighbouring swampland known as Bleakmarsh, which serves as a convenient refuge and source of cover for those seeking to evade capture.

She explained how it was accessible through reciting a traditional ritual which could only take place in one of their temples.","\n","^<i> Her voice quivered, and then in tears she dutifully described the arrival of the Equistadian colonisers, who she called 'Thuum', and the subsequent destruction of the walls, the city, and the temples.","\n","ev","str","^Turn page.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Stop reading.","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Pip11"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"Stop"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Pip11":[["^<i>\"Ah, but Aama one still stands, right?\" Kaya interrupted, placing a comforting hand on Naani's shoulder to steady her.","\n","^<i>\"Yes, my dear.
