The raindrops pelt your body mercilessly, turning your clothes into sodden shrouds that cling to your skin. The wind howls, lashing against your face, and whipping wet strands of hair across your eyes. Darkness looms overhead - the sky a tempestuous canvas of roiling clouds that obscure the moon and stars, casting an eerie gloom over the land.","\n","ev","str","^Walk forward","/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Forward"},"\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Forward":[["^As you draw closer to the tavern, its name, \"The Rose & Crown,\" comes into focus, etched in weathered wood above the door.

The air is thick with the heady aroma of ale and hearth, a scent that stirs memories of hearthside tales and shared laughter.","\n","^A handful of patrons huddle around wooden tables, their faces etched with weariness and a touch of merriment. They raise their tankards and exchange boisterous banter, their conversations blending harmoniously with the soft melody of a lute in the corner. A smiling innkeeper stands behind the polished counter, his eyes kind and welcoming, ready to tend to the needs of weary travellers seeking refuge from the storm. As you enter, a collective glance momentarily shifts toward you, the stranger drenched by the relentless rain.
